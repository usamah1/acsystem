# Air Conditioning System

Air Conditioning System

- Developed multi-tasking real-time embedded system using Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
and Finite State Machines in C++.

- The system automatically controls the temperature of a room based on changes in ambient
temperature, maintaining the temperature within the user-specified limits.

- Push buttons were used to set the system's lower and upper limits. LEDs are used to indicate
whether the system is in heat mode or cool mode, as well as to indicate all the different tasks are
functioning well altogether. Implemented using 74HC595.

- All were developed using interrupts, timers, and state machines without the use of loop () function.
